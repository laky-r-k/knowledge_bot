KALPANA-1
Metsat is an exclusive meteorological satellite of ISRO in geo-synchronous orbit. This satellite is developed out of a small I-1000 bus made of carbon fibre re-enforced plastic light weight structure, a uni power bus employing an 18AH Ni-Cd battery and a single GaAs/Ge solar panel generating 640 watts of power. Metsat uses a 3-axis stabilized momentum biased attitude control system with suitable linearly controlled magnetic torquers for solar radiation pressure compensation. A unified propulsion system of bi-propellant apogee motor of 440 Newtons and the reaction control engines of 22 Newtons has been selected for efficient and versatile mission management.
Metsat carries on-board a Very High ResolutionRadiometer (VHRR) and a Data Relay Transponder (DRT) for weather data transmission. VHRR provides earth imageries in visible band with a resolution of2 km, in thermal infrared and water vapor bands with 8 km. DRT collects weather data from un-attended data collection platforms located throughout India and transmits the same to centrally located Meteorological Data Utilisation Centre. The satellite dry mass is about 495 kg. Metsat was launched on- board upgraded and modified satellite launch vehicle (PSLV) with a lift–off mass of 1060 kgs in September 2002. After successful launch and early orbit operations and in orbit characterization of the Payload, the satellite has been commissioned for routine usage of weather data and imageries.

INSAT-3A
INSAT-3A is a multipurpose satellite for providing telecommunications, television broadcasting, meteorological and search & rescue services. It carries twenty four transponders - twelve operating in the normal C-band frequency, six in Extended C-band and six in Ku-band. Nine of the twelve normal C-band transponders provide expanded coverage and the remaining three have India coverage beam. All the extended C-band as well as the Ku-band transponders has India coverage beams. INSAT-3A also carries a Ku-band beacon. For meteorological observation, INSAT-3A carries a three channel Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR) with 2 km resolution in the visible band and 8 km resolution in thermal infrared and water vapour bands. In addition, INSAT-3A carries a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) camera which operates in the visible and short wave infrared bands providing a spatial resolution of 1 km. A Data Relay Transponder (DRT) operating in UHF band is incorporated for realtime hydro-meteorological data collection from unattended platforms located on land and river basins. The data is then relayed in extended C-band to a central location. INSAT-3A also carries another transponder for Satellite Aided Search and Rescue (SAS & R) as part of India's contribution to the international Satellite Aided Search and Rescue programme. INSAT-3A was launched by European Ariane-5G Launch Vehicle into a Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) with a perigee of 200 km and an apogee of 35,980 km. The satellite is maneuvered to its final orbit by firing the satellite's apogee motor. Subsequently, the deployment of solar array, antennae and the solar sail is carried out and the satellite is commissioned after in-orbit checkout.

Megha Tropiques
Megha-Tropiques is an Indo-French Joint Satellite Mission for studying the water cycle and energy exchanges in the tropics. The main objective of this mission is to understand the life cycle of convective systems that influence the tropical weather and climate and their role in associated energy and moisture budget of the atmosphere in tropical regions. Megha-Tropiques provides scientific data on the contribution of the water cycle to the tropical atmosphere, with information on condensed water in clouds, water vapour in the atmosphere, precipitation, and evaporation. With its circular orbit inclined 20 deg to the equator, the Megha-Tropiques is a unique satellite for climate research that should also aid scientists seeking to refine prediction models. The Megha-Tropiques has day, night and all-weather viewing capabilities; it passes over India almost a dozen times every day, giving scientists an almost real- time assessment of the evolution of clouds.

SARAL-AltiKa
SARAL mission results from the common interest of both CNES and ISRO in studying ocean from space using altimetry system and in promoting maximum use of the ARGOS Data Collecting System. Radar altimetry by satellite is a technique used in oceanography to measure, globally over the oceans, the sea level needed to understand ocean circulation and its variability. The importance of altimetry data to better understand the ocean circulation and its impact on the climate of the Earth led to the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series of satellites complemented by ERS1-2, GFO and ENVISAT. With the launch of these missions began a data collection that must continue well into the century in order to monitor the inter-annual evolution and separate transient phenomena from secular variations. SARAL/AltiKa mission belongs to the global altimetry system and then participates to the precise and accurate observations of ocean circulation and sea surface elevation for its life time. Thus it is the aim of AltiKa part of the SARAL mission to provide altimetric measurements designed to study ocean circulation and sea surface elevation with the same accuracy as the one provided by ENVISAT mission and complementary to Jasons mission. The AltiKa project developed by CNES is based on a large Ka-band altimeter (35.75 GHz, 500MHz), 1st oceanographic altimeter using such a high frequency. The use of the Ka-band frequency will supply more accurate measurements (improvement of the spatial and vertical resolution) enabling a better observation of ices, coastal areas, continental water bodies as well as the waves height. The drawback of this Ka-band frequency is its sensitivity to rain that can lead to signal attenuation. The SARAL/AltiKa mission is part of the operational satellite altimetry system, jointly with Jason-2, and enables to ensure the service continuity which is nowadays provided by ENVISAT altimeter jointly with Jason-2 and Jason-1. By ensuring the observations continuity and widening the observation areas, CNES answers the wish of the oceanography community by bringing a description: For the meso-scale in open ocean,, In coastal areas, For the seasonal forecast, For the hydrology, For the climate studies. AltiKa data will thus contribute, along with data from others altimetry missions, to the development of operational oceanography, to our climate understanding and to the development of forecasting capabilities through data assimilation methods improvement in coupled oceanatmosphere coupling models, bio-chemistry models, etc

Bayesian based MT-SAPHIR rainfall
Megha- Tropiques (MT) is a joint Indo-French collaborative satellite mission, which is launched on 12 October 2011. The main objective of MT is to get more understanding on convective system, energy exchange and water cycle in the tropical region. It is equipped with Microwave Analysis and Detection of Rain and Atmospheric Structures (MADRAS) (not in operational), Scanner for Radiation Budget, Radio Occultation Sensor for Atmosphere and  Sondeur Atmospherique du Profil d’Humidite Intertropical par Radiometrie (SAPHIR). SAPHIR provides clear sky atmospheric humidity profiles at 6-channels near 183.31GHz water vapour resonance. The observations of SAPHIR  provides an opportunity to estimate rainfall using 183.31GHz channels.  A Bayesian based rainfall retrieval technique is developed using SAPHIR channel-6 (183.31±11GHz) brightness temperature observations. Estimated rainfall has been validated with IMERG and DPR products during Jan-Dec 2017. The global distribution of rainfall patterns are captured well by the estimation.

Title
Bayesian based MT-SAPHIR rainfall
6
Abstract
Megha- Tropiques (MT) is a joint Indo-French collaborative satellite mission, which is launched on 12 October 2011. The main objective of MT is to get more understanding on convective system, energy exchange and water cycle in the tropical region. It is equipped with Microwave Analysis and Detection of Rain and Atmospheric Structures (MADRAS) (not in operational), Scanner for Radiation Budget and Radio Occultation Sensor for Atmosphere and  Sondeur Atmospherique du Profil d’Humidite Intertropical par Radiometrie (SAPHIR). SAPHIR provides clear sky atmospheric humidity profiles at 6-channels near 183.31GHz water vapour resonance. The observations of SAPHIR  provides an opportunity to estimate rainfall using 183.31GHz channels.  A Bayesian based rainfall retrieval technique is developed using SAPHIR channel-6 (183.31±11GHz) brightness temperature observations. Estimated rainfall has been validated with IMERG and DPR products during Jan-Dec 2017. The global distribution of rainfall patterns are captured well by the estimation.

GPS derived Integrated water vapour
This dataset contains Integrated Water Vapor (IWV) estimates derived from GPS receivers that comprise the GAGAN TEC network. These receivers have been installed at airports at various locations in India. The Zenith Tropospheric Delay was estimated from the GPS observations using the GAMIT software. Further, IWV was estimated from the ZTD values using surface temperature and pressure from ERA-I reanalysis as additional inputs. The GAGAN-IWV estimates for 1 year – March 2013 to February 2014 – have currently been made available.

GSMap ISRO Rain
The GSMaP_ISRO is a precipitation product that was developed through the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) - Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Implementation of Agreement (IA) specifically for the Indian subcontinent. It is currently available from March 2000 Onwards and offers a horizontal resolution of 0.1°X 0.1° on a latitude/longitude grid with a temporal resolution of 1 hour. The dataset is based on the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) algorithm (Kubota et al. 2020; Kumar et al. 2021, 2022) with Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) gauge correction, and is a specialized product that focuses on the Indian landmass. The GSMaP algorithm, designed by the JAXA, is instrumental in creating a comprehensive view of precipitation using microwave radiometers and cloud moving data from Geostationary Infrared (IR) technology. The algorithm is separated into three primary categories for effective measurement: the microwave imager, microwave sounder, and microwave-infrared (MVK) combined (Mega et al. 2019). A detailed verification of GSMaP_ISRO for the Indian summer monsoon periods of 2000-2020 against ground, satellite and various merge rainfall products is presented in Kumar et al. (2022).

Title
Post processing of TERLS DWR data and Volumetric Gridding

Abstract
The TERLS DWR data has been processed to correct for clutter and velocity folding prior to their application in hydrological and numerical weather prediction models. The radar reflectivity has been corrected for clutter using a combination of a spatial continuity filter and a fuzzy-logic based echo classification algorithm. The velocity folded regions are dealiased using a 2D multipass velocity dealiasing algorithm. The corrected reflectivity and radial velocity are then gridded into 1 km x 1 km x 250 m 3D volumetric grid which can be used by scientists for further meteorological applications. This data was prepared under the TDP/R&D project “Storm Tracking and Prediction using Doppler Weather Radar

Inland Water Height
It is crucial to know how the storage of inland water bodies change over time. Also, hydrological modelling studies face the challenge of decreasing availability of in-situ monitoring data. However, application of satellite radar altimetry over the inland water bodies becomes vital tool to estimate water levels through waveform retracking on satellite altimetry?s sensor data. SARAL-Altika was launched on 25 February 2013. It is a joint-mission of CNES France and ISRO to provide continuous monitoring of ocean and continental water surface. It was launched into a Sun synchronous polar orbit at an altitude of 790km with 35 days of orbit repetition and follows same ground track as ENVISAT satellite. It has 98.55 deg of inclination with 75 km of equatorial cross track separation. It has Ka-band (35.75 GHz) radar altimeter. Water level product for inland water bodies (presently for Brahmaputra river and Ukai Reservoir) has been generated using the SARAL-ALTIKA waveform data.

Processing Steps
Firstly the waveforms are classified based on their signature, and then these waveforms are retracked with the suitable retracker.
Dedicated inland range correction algorithms are required to account for the atmospheric delays.Detailed information about the processing can be found in (S. Chanderet. al. 2014, A .Dubey et. al. 2014).

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm
The water level over the inland water bodies can be retrieved using altimeter waveforms data.
The range information is estimated based on the arrival time of the radar pulse.
This range is then corrected for Dry tropospheric correction, wet tropospheric correction, ionospheric correction, and tidal correction, i.e. Load tide, solid earth tide.
Detailed information about the range corrections can be found in the ATBD document (S. Chander and Prakash Chauhan, 2013) of the SARAL mission.
Limitations
Based on the availability of the Altimeter dataset over the study region (Data Gap, altimeter track loss, bad weather, etc.).
Known problems with data
Data problems due to bad weather (heavy rain)

River Discharge
River heights from satellite altimeters (ENVISAT, Jason-2 and SARAL AltiKa) have been derived at two cross-over points along Godavari River. Subsequently, river height discharge stage relationship between altimetry derived heights and In-situ river discharge has been established. Using this relationship, river discharge database for Godavari River for the period i.e. 2002 - 2015 has been generated.

Global Ocean Surface Current
The Global Ocean Surface Current defined here as the average current for the top 0 to 30m layer is derived from the synergistic use of three different satellite derived parameters. The first one is the Altimeter derived gridded Map of Absolute Dynamic Topography (MADT) generated from the suite of altimeters such as JASON-2, SARAL/ALTIKA, Cryosat etc., the second data set is the gridded ocean surface vector winds derived ASCAT wind data and the last one is the gridded SST data derived from AVHRR. The methodology presented by Bonjean and Lagerloef, (2002) is used to derive ocean surface current by combining the geostrophic component from altimeter data and the ageostrophic component from scatterometer and radiometer data. The method of deriving the surface current is based on the resolution of quasi-steady quasi-linear momentum equations, neglecting local acceleration. Equatorial velocities are obtained by solving a weak formulation of the momentum equations using a basis set of orthogonal polynomials.

Processing Steps
Using the daily gridded data of MADT, Vector winds and SST data the Geostrophic, wind driven and buoyancy components of the ocean surface current respectively are first calculated for the off-equatorial regions (3°N to 90°N and 3°S to 90°S).
Using the polynomial expansion the equatorial currents (±3° latitude band) are derived.
The daily ocean surface current at 0.25° resolution is then derived by applying a linear weighted average procedure to the equatorial and off equatorial current solutions with in the latitude band of ± 3° to ± 4° band.

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm
The methodology follows the work of Bonjean and Lagerloef (2002). The basic equations are those of quasi linear and steady flow in a surface layer where the horizontal velocity U = (u,v) is allowed to vary with vertical coordinate
z
, and where vertical turbulent mixing is characterized by an eddy viscosity
A
uniform with depth. The vertical shear U
z
reaches zero at a constant scaling depth
z
= -
H
. Using complex notations
U(x,y,z,t) = u + iv and ∇ = ∂/∂x + i ∂/∂y
, the basic equations are
if
U = - (1/ρ
m
) ∇ p + AU
z
(1a)
(1/ρm) p
z
= -g + ∇θ
(1b)
∇θ = g χ
T
∇SST ,
(1c)
with - H ≤ z ≤ 0, and subject to the following boundary conditions
U
z
(z=0) = τ / A
(2a)
U
z
(z = -H) = 0
(2b)
The characteristic density is ρ
m
= 1025 kg m
-3
,
The acceleration due to gravity g = 9.8 m s

,
and the coefficient of thermal expansion χT = 3 x 10

K

,
The vector field τ = τ
x
+ i τ
y
represents the surface wind stress divided by ρ
m
,
H has been chosen to be 70 m,
The parameter A is chosen by the empirical formulation as A = a (|W|/W1)
b
| w| 1 m s
-1
where W
1
= 1 m s

, a = 8 x 10

m

s

, and b = 2.2
where W
1
= 1 m s
-1
, a = 8 x 10
-5
m
2
s
-1
, and b = 2.2 .
The equation for the velocity shear is
U
z
- (if/A) U
z
= (1/A)∇θ
(3)
which is a second-order differential equation in velocity shear Uz , subject to the boundary conditions (2a,b). After solving for the shear profiles, one can find an expression for the velocity at the surface, which is
if
U
0
= -g ∇ζ + (1/H ) q(H/h
e
)τ + ((H/2)/q(H/2he))∇θ
(4)
Here the function q is defined by q (x) = x /tanh (x) and h
e
= (A/if )
1/2
is complex and its modulus is proportional to the Ekman depth h
e
= sqrt( 2A/|f|).
Using equation (4) and the datasets mentioned above, the daily ocean surface currents were generated. Equatorial velocities (±3° latitude band) are obtained by solving a weak formulation of the momentum equations using a basis set of orthogonal polynomials as described in Bonjean and Lagerloef (2002).
Limitations
As the equatorial currents are estimated through an approximation procedure using polynomial coefficients the correlation with in-situ currents in the equatorial region is observed to be relatively poorer especially for the meridional currents.
Known problems with data
As these input satellite data are not very reliable near to the coast, the estimated currents very near to the coast may also have problems.

High Resolution Sea Surface Salinity
The Bay of Bengal's high-resolution sea surface salinity has been reconstructed using a Lagrangian technique leveraging satellite data. The primary input datasets utilized are sea surface salinity data from the SMAP mission and sea surface currents derived from altimetry. These datasets are obtained at a spatial resolution of 25 km. The SMAP mission has been operational since 2015, whereas altimetry-derived sea surface currents have been available since 1993. Validation of this reconstructed product was conducted against in-situ datasets obtained from thermo-salinographs. Results indicate that the reconstructed product more accurately captures front formation compared to the original SMAP salinity fields.

Processing Steps
i. Remap Sea Surface Currents with a spatial resolution of 5 km.
ii. Backward advection of particles from the final time {t} rsub {f} to the initial time {t} rsub {f} -14 , where 14 is the number of days the particles are advected using Runge-Kutta 4th order method.
iii. The SMAP Sea Surface Salinity observed at {t} rsub {f} -14 is interpolated onto the particle positions that day.
iv. With this, each particle has an SSS value on {t} rsub {f} day that corresponds to the observation at {t} rsub {f} -14 .

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm
The algorithm is called Lagrangian Reconstruction Technique. User should refer [1].
Limitations
This algorithm is applicable only in the region with moderate to high eddy kinetic energy and where lateral advection dominates.
High resolution sea surface salinity product generated by Lagrangian technique can have error due to tracer bias (depends on accuracy of initial conditions) and advection bias (Passive stirring can introduce bias due to mixing physics (air-sea fluxes, mixing etc.)).
Known problems with data
Data sets have biases as well as inaccuracy.

Title
Dynamic downscaling of Satellite Sea Surface Salinity for the Bay of Bengal
6
Abstract
Lagrangian technique is used for generating high-resolution sea surface salinity fields in the Bay of Bengal. This is achieved through the utilization of Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) data derived from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, in conjunction with sea surface currents obtained from altimetry. By employing forward and backward schemes for the numerical advection of SMAP SSS fields using altimeter-derived geostrophic currents, a Lagrangian reconstruction is produced, capturing smaller-scale features. The reliability of our in-house developed algorithm is assessed by comparing it with an available reconstructed product in the Gulf Stream. Additionally, a preliminary validation is conducted against insitu data obtained from a thermo-salinograph. Further, the developed algorithm was modified to select the advection time dynamically.

Indian Mainland Coastal Product
SARAL/AltiKa was launched on 25 February 2013 as a joint collaboration mission of ISRO and CNES. With smaller footprint than earlier satellite altimeters, SARAL/AltiKa has improved coastal performance. Specific waveform processing has been used in this product to derive along track geophysical parameters (Sea Surface Height, Significant wave height and wind speed) from the altimeter 40-Hz waveform data. This product is generated for Indian mainland coastal region (up to 50 km from the coast). This product is available for 35 cycles of SARAL/AltiKa starting from March 2013 through July 2016.

High resolution coastline
Processing Steps
i. High resolution bathymetry is used to separate the coastal and land waveforms.
ii. Waveforms are classified based on their shape.
iii. Waveforms are retracked with the beta parameter retrackers (BETA5 and BETA9) and BAGP (Brown with asymmetric Gaussian Peak) retracker to get sea surface height (SSH), sea surface height anomaly (SSHA), significant wave height (SWH) and wind speed.
iv. Using Significant Wave Height (SWH) and wind speed, the wave period is derived based on the data adaptive technique of &quot; Genetic Algorithm &quot; (Remya et al. 2011)
v. Wave power is derived based on SWH and estimated wave period. 40 Hz data is filtered using a lanczos filter to remove high frequency noise.
vi. Wind power is calculated using standard wind power formula. 40 Hz data is filtered using a lanczos filter to remove high frequency noise.

4. T is wave period (in seconds)
5. ρ is the density of water (in kilogram/cubic meter)
6. g is the acceleration due to gravity (in meters/square seconds)
Wind power is generated by using;
We have assumed unit area in this equation. is density of air and is wind speed.
Limitations
Based on the availability of the Altimeter dataset over the study region (Data Gap, altimeter track loss, bad weather, etc.). Geophysical and atmospheric range corrections have been obtained from the standard 1-Hz product of SARAL/AltiKa.
Known problems with data
Data problems due to bad weather (heavy rain).
Onboard tracker failure leads to unusable data.
Coastal contamination may lead to erroneous estimate of the derived parameters.

Title
SARAL/AltiKa Coastal Product (Indian region) and Wind Wave Power product
6
Abstract
SARAL, a joint ISRO-CNES satellite mission, was successfully launched in 2013. It carries a Ka band single frequency satellite altimeter (AltiKa). Satellite altimeters are primarily used to study sea level changes. In the open ocean, the altimetric echo follows a standard shape, with steeply rising leading edge followed by a trailing edge with gradually diminishing power. This standard shape is in agreement with the theoretical Brown model and hence can be easily modeled. However, in the coastal areas, due to the presence of land and other coastal featues in the footprint of the altimeter, contamination occurs and the return is different from open ocean. Up to some extent these contaminations can be modeled. Footprint size of SARAL/Altika is small which is ideal for coastal studies. The available ocean retracker (MLE4) itself shows good performance near the coast. However, further improvemnts can be achieved by using algorithms which can simulate contaminations impact in the coastal areas. In this document we have used various models for the return waveforms at 40 Hz to extract maximum information from the altimeter. Our results show that algorithms which are useful in the coastal areas are BETA5, BETA9 and Brown with Asymmetric Gaussian Peak (BAGP). Additionally, a wind power and wave power product has also been generated from this coastal product.

Ocean Subsurface
Satellite data has been used to reconstruct ocean interior density and velocity anomalies in the Bay of Bengal through the “interior + surface Quasigeostrophic” (isQG) method. The inputs are sea surface height anomaly (AVISO), sea surface density anomaly; which is calculated using GHRSST sea surface temperature and SMAP sea surface salinity. One more input is the Brunt-Vaisala frequency, calculated from in-situ analysis system (ISAS) climatological data. The results show that isQG retrieved subsurface density anomalies are very promising compared to RAMA buoy data in the cold season when EKE is minimum. Validation of retrieved density has also been performed using ARGO data which reveals that isQG is more promising when the stratification is weak .

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm
The algorithm is called interior + surface Quasi-Geostrophic(isQG) method. User should refer doi:10.1175/JPO-D-12-0204.1.
Limitations
This method is only applicable in a region where the Coriolis parameter does not change abruptly. Also it is not applicable on the equator.
Vertical movement is ignored in isQG framework.
isQG method works well when the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) is low. If EKE is large, it will fail to generate accurate subsurface fields.
We considered the Barotropic and the first Baroclinic modes only in our analysis. This certainly limits our approach.
This method generates less satisfactory subsurface fields if the stratification is strong.
The vertical resolution in our case is 10 m. This is a major drawback since in Bay of Bengal, the mixed layer can be as shallow as 15-20 m.
Known problems with data
Data problems due to bad weather (heavy rain) and extreme events like cyclones etc.

Oceanic Eddies Detection
The oceanic eddy parameter information was prepared for 24 years (1993 – 2016) over Bay of Bengal using AVISO. Merged and gridded satellite altimeter product of sea surface height (SSH) anomaly at 7-day interval having special resolution of 0.25o has been used for present study. Mesoscale oceanic eddies have been identified and tracked in weekly merged altimeter product of Sea Surface Height (SSH) from AVISO. Eddies have been identified based on closed contour approach followed by shape criteria. An automated tracking algorithm has been employed to track these eddies with different lifetime. The trajectories of eddies have been computed from their time history. Present method has been used separately for cold core and warm core eddies. There are 24 files each containing weekly eddy data information for individual year.

Data Version
Version 1.0 (beta)
Data Sources
The daily gridded map of Absolute Dynamic Topography data is obtained from AVISO
ftp site (
ftp://ftp.aviso.oceanobs.com
)
Website (
http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com/
)
Processing Steps
Remove the long wavelength component of the SSH anomaly and retain the mesoscale features with the wavelength 50-500 km scale.
Identified outer most closed contour of SSH anomaly.
The closed contours are sequentially identified, analysed and checked essential criteria.
Size and amplitude based thresholds for eddy detection were fixed after carrying out several trials.
Eddies are detected and calculated the eddy parameters.
Detected eddies are tracked individually.

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm
We have followed Chelton et. Al. 2007 in deriving the eddy census in Bay of Bengal with minor modifications in fixing the thresholds for eddy detection specific to this region. This was achieved after performing several trial experiments with different combinations of size and amplitude values.
Limitations
Accuracy assessment of the dataset has not been carried out. The number of eddies are depending upon the diameter and amplitude threshold. Only mesoscale eddies with maximum diameter of 400km are being considered.
Known problems with data
Less reliability of SSH data near the coast with altimetry is a known problem.

Sea Ice Occurrence Probability
The Sea Ice Occurrence Probability (SIOP36) data were prepared from 36 years (October 1978 to December 2014) NSIDC sea ice concentration (SIC) data over the Antarctic Region (Cavalieri, 1996). The SIC data were downloaded from NSIDC data site:(
http://nsidc.org/data
(link is external)). The SIOP36 data consist of 366 data files corresponding to 366 days with the first file representing 1st January and the last, 31st December. The file naming nomenclature follows SIOP36_MMDD_S.bin[.tif/.png] format; where MM refers to month number (01 to 12, 01 being January), DD refers to date of the month, and the character S refers to Southern Hemishphere.
Data formats are indicated by .bin (Binary), .tif (GeoTIFF), and .png (Portable Network Graphics). Data is freely available to global scientific community and can be downloaded from
www.mosdac.gov.in
(link is external). Probability values are calculated from the long-term NASA Team algorithm-derived SMMR-SSM/I-SSMIS sea ice concentration product (Cavalieri, 1996). The dataset is given in Polar Stereographic projection with a grid size of 25km x 25km in latitude and longitude. The grid coordinates of the upper left pixel are 39.2 deg S, 42.2 deg W. There are 316 columns and 332 rows. Data values are stored as IEEE floats representing probabilities in the range 0-100%. Pixels with zero values corresponds to either Antarctic land/ice or ocean water.

Wave based Renewable Energy
AWARE demonstrates potential renewable energy resource available from ocean waves over Indian Ocean region. The product is based on observations of the recent altimeters Jason-2 (2008-2014) and SARAL/Altika (2013-2014). It is particularly helpful in identification of ocean hotspots for extraction of ocean wave energy, that can be the next generation, environment friendly energy resource.It provides two types of products: Inter-annual monthly product from Jason-2 and SARAL/ALTIKA, Monthly climatology of ocean wave energy.
Data Access

Data Version
Version 1.0 (beta)
Data Sources
The significant wave height (SWH) and wind speed for both the altimeters are taken from
Jason-2 (
http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com
)
SARAL/ALTIKA (
http://www.mosdac.gov.in
)
Processing Steps
Using Significant Wave Height (SWH) and wind speed, the wave period is derived based on the data adaptive technique of " Genetic Algorithm " (Remya et al. 2011)
Wave period hence derived is validated using buoy observations from Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS)
Wave power is derived based on SWH and estimated wave period

SCORPIO (Satellite Based Cyclone Observation and Real-time Prediction over Indian Ocean) is a WebGIS based Cyclone Information System. Accurate and timely advance prediction of tropical cyclones is very important to disseminate the warnings and preparedness. Prediction of development of any cyclone system in the North Indian Ocean is being done at Space Applications Centre (ISRO) Ahmedabad, using the in-house developed algorithms. Once the low-pressure system is formed, it is continuously monitored by satellite observations. The forecasts like cyclogenesis, track, intensity and landfall of cyclones, ship avoidance region, storm surge, coastal inundation etc. and satellite based cyclone information are disseminated through web-portal SCORPIO.
This is an experimental forecast. This information is to be used along with other reliable data sources for interpretation. SAC/ISRO/MOSDAC should not be made responsible for any loss or damage incurred.
